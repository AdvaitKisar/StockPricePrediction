# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is particularly effective for sequential data. The analysis includes stock prices from companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India and NASDAQ, as well as the USD-INR exchange rate. The dataset primarily covers data from 2019 to 2021.

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to analyze historical stock prices and predict future prices to assist investors in making informed decisions. LSTM networks are chosen due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in time-series data, making them suitable for stock price prediction.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdvaitKisar/StockPricePrediction.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
   cd StockPricePrediction
   ```

3. **Use the Jupyter Notebook to understand the code.**

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset consists of multiple CSV files containing stock prices with columns for Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. The preprocessing steps include:
- Handling Missing Values: Linear interpolation is used to fill missing values to maintain the integrity of the time series.
- Normalization: Data is normalized using MinMaxScaler to scale features between 0 and 1.
- Train-Test Split: The data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

## Model Architecture
The LSTM model architecture includes:
- Two LSTM layers with 128 and 64 units respectively.
- Dropout layers added to prevent overfitting.
- Fully connected layers to output predictions.
The model is trained using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the loss function.

## Results
The predictions generated by the model are visualized alongside actual stock prices. Key observations include:
- The model performs well in predicting opening prices for most stocks.
- The accuracy varies across different stocks, with some performing better than others based on MAE metrics.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of LSTM networks in predicting stock prices based on historical data. Future work may explore advanced techniques such as Hybrid Approaches, Attention Mechanisms, or Graph Neural Networks to enhance prediction accuracy.
